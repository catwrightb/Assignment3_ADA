# Assignment3_ADA

A persistent dynamic set is a set which maintains past versions of itself as it gets updated. The purpose of this group assignment is to develop an efficient data structure for a persistent dynamic set of Comparable elements.

The assignment includes the following components:
  - Binary Search Tree
  - Persistent Dynamic Set BST
  - Balanced Persistent Dynamic Set (Red Black Tree)

Requirment include extend all Persistent Trees from a comparable BST which does not use Parent pointers, use helper hook methods, Red Black Tree balances correctly, both Red Black and the Persistent Dynamic Set BST Tree have accessable versions, node addition and removal is avaliable for all classes.
